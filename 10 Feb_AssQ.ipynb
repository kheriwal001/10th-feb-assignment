    "Q.1>  Which function is used to open a file? What are the different modes of opening a file? Explain each mode \n",

    "        \n",
    "     Here are the different modes of file opening:\n",
    "\n",
    "     1. 'r' (Read Only): This is the default mode. It opens the file for reading and the pointer is placed \n",
    "         at the beginning of the file. If the file does not exist, an error is raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "     2. 'w' (Write Only): This mode opens the file for writing. If the file already exists, its contents \n",
    "         are truncated, and if it does not exist, a new file is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "     3. 'a' (Append Only): This mode opens the file for writing but the pointer is placed at the end of \n",
    "        the file. If the file does not exist, a new file is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "     4. 'x' (Exclusive Creation): This mode opens the file for writing but raises a FileExistsError if \n",
    "        the file already exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "     5. 'b' (Binary): This mode opens the file in binary mode, which is used for non-text files like \n",
    "        images and audio files.\n",
    "\n",
    "     6. 't' (Text): This mode opens the file in text mode (default)."

    "Q.2> Why close() function is used? Why is it important to close a file?\n",
    "Ans> The close() function is used to close a file in Python. Closing a file is an important step because \n",
    "     it ensures that all changes made to the file are saved and the resources used by the file are released.\n",
    "\n",
    "     When you open a file, the operating system reserves memory and other resources for the file so that you \n",
    "     can read from or write to the file. If you don't close the file, the resources used by the file will not \n",
    "     be released, which can cause performance problems and memory leaks. In some cases, it can also result in \n",
    "     data loss or corruption, because the file may still be open and being used by another process even after \n",
    "     your program has finished executing.\n",
    "     To avoid these problems, it's a best practice to use the close() function."
